## 📂 Problem Summary

### 1️⃣ Top Performing Employees
Identified highest performance score from a dictionary and handled tie cases to display all eligible employees.

**Concepts Used:** `max()`, dictionary iteration, list comprehension

---

### 2️⃣ Keyword Frequency Counter
Converted text to lowercase, removed punctuation, counted word frequency, and filtered repeated keywords.

**Concepts Used:** string processing, dictionary frequency counting

---

### 3️⃣ Sensor Data Validation
Filtered valid (even) sensor readings and stored them as `(hour_index, value)` pairs.

**Concepts Used:** `enumerate()`, conditional filtering, tuples

---

### 4️⃣ Email Domain Analysis
Calculated domain-wise usage count and percentage distribution from a list of emails.

**Concepts Used:** string splitting, dictionary counting, percentage calculation

---

### 5️⃣ Sales Performance Detection
Computed average daily sales and identified days exceeding 30% above average.

**Concepts Used:** arithmetic operations, threshold logic, iteration

---

### 6️⃣ Duplicate User ID Detection
Detected duplicate user IDs and displayed frequency of repeated entries.

**Concepts Used:** dictionary counting, `collections.Counter`, filtering logic
